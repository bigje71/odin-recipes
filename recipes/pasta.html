    <p>Anyone can make a Pesto Pasta, but not everyone knows how to make a pesto pasta that's slick with plenty of pesto sauce without adding tons of extra oil! Here's how I make it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <br>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons pesto</li>
        <br>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <br>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer into a large bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.</li>
    </ol>
